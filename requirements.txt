# If you're getting "Import 'pandas' could not be resolved from source",
# it means your environment doesn't have `pandas` installed or your VSCode Python interpreter is not correctly set.

# ✅ First: Install required libraries
# Open your terminal in VSCode (or PowerShell in your project directory), then run:

# ✅ Second: Ensure VSCode is using the correct Python interpreter
# In VSCode:
# 1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or F1)
# 2. Search for: "Python: Select Interpreter"
# 3. Choose the one that shows your current environment (where `pandas` is installed)

# ✅ Third: Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies
# In your project folder, create a new file named `requirements.txt` and add:

pandas
openpyxl
streamlit
python-dotenv
openai

# Then later you (or your teammates) can set up the environment with:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
